        Cinema is very common in India. Everyone is entertained by cinema and
        enjoys it for nearly three hours. Cinema came into existence in 1930. At
        first silent and black & white movies were made. After that coloured
        movies were made. Seeing a movie is not at all costly as compared to the
        other sources of entertainment. That is why everyone likes to see a film
        in a cinema hall. Cinema has its merits and demerits too. If a person
        sees a bad film then he can adopt all the bad points of the film. To see
        too much of films can spoil our eyesight, waste our money, time and
        energy. A person who be­comes a film fan wants to see every film at any
        cost, which is not at all good. Now-a-days cinema has become very
        popular and it is a good source of entertainment.

        A movie review is an evaluation of a particular film that includes a
        summary of the movie and any relevant analysis and opinion. Filmgoers
        commonly use movie reviews to determine whether they should watch a
        specific release or better inform their personal opinion after an
        initial viewing. A movie review can be a complete, in-depth analysis or
        a simple blurb sharing a personal perspective about the film’s events.
        You can write, record, or film a movie review for blogs, news
        publications, entertainment podcasts, radio broadcasts, television, or
        streaming platforms.
